#general
DIS is YASB.  This time it's docker-in-dockerized.  Dis gives you the ability to realize your wildest slack dreams just by installing new containers and running them (in slack)

#build

make
./run

#usage
You need a slack token, so get one of those.

```
    docker run --privileged -e SLACK_TOKEN='' dis
```

```
In the slack channel:
@yourbotname help
```
